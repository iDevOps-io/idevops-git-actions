# AWS Route 53 Record Set

This GitHub Actions allows you to manage [AWS Route 53](https://aws.amazon.com/route53/) Record Sets. 

The naming is aligned with the official interface: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/route53/change-resource-record-sets.html. There you can find possible variations for every Input this GitHub Action supports.

## Get started

A new AWS Route 53 Record Set can be created with the following workflow syntax:

```yaml
jobs:
  aws_route53:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: "Create an A record set"
        uses: Roosterfish/aws-route53-record-set-action@master
        with: 
          aws_access_key_id: ${{ secrets.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID }}
          aws_secret_access_key: ${{ secrets.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY }}
          aws_route53_hosted_zone_id: ${{ secrets.AWS_ROUTE53_HOSTED_ZONE_ID }}
          aws_route53_rr_action: "CREATE"
          aws_route53_rr_name: "your-fqdn.example.com"
          aws_route53_rr_type: "A"
          aws_route53_rr_ttl: "300"
          aws_route53_rr_value: "1.2.3.4"
```
